# Buffer Overflow Windows Exploit Development Practice
**What this repo is:** For my up and coming battle with the infamous OSCE certification exam, I challenged myself to re-write as many proof of concepts for pre-existing exploits in various Windows based software as I could.


Absolutely NO looking at the original exploits or POC!

These POC's are purely for educational purposes.

I want to keep this repo within the scope of the OSCE course, which includes: Vanilla EIP Overwrite, SEH (+ egghunter), ASLR Bypass, and unicode restrictions.

## Vanilla Stack Based Buffer Overflow

1. Vulnserver TRUN vanilla EIP overflow


---
## Structured Exception Handler (SEH) Overflow + Egghunter

1. Vulnserver GMON SEH overflow

**With Egghunter:** [2004 whitepaper](http://www.hick.org/code/skape/papers/egghunt-shellcode.pdf)
1. Vulnserver GMON SEH overflow + EggHunter

## Overflow Character Restrictions:
**Unicode restrictions:**
Nothing Yet!

**Alphanumeric Restrictions:**
Nothing Yet!
